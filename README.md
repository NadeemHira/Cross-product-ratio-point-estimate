# Comparing Cross-product-ratio-point-estimate from different sampling schemes.

Recent advances in clinical trials have produced effective results for the treatment
and prevention of diseases. Therefore, there is always a need of improvement in the way that
clinical trials are conducted. This paper aims to compute the point estimates for the crossproduct ratio 
ρ = p1(1−p2)/p2(1−p1) from two independent Bernoulli samples and determine the best
sampling scheme.The idea of using Bernoulli samples to conduct clinical trials has been very
successful since it is very simple and cost effective. The participants are enrolled in the clinical
trials using the Direct or Inverse Binomial sampling schemes. The paper determines normal
approximations for the point estimators of the cross product ratio. Bias and Mean Squared
Error are used as the principal criteria. According to the simulation results, the special case of
Direct-Inverse Binomial sampling scheme works the best, where the number of successes in the
Direct sampling scheme is used in the second sampling scheme of the Inverse binomial scheme.
This technique gives the best estimate as compared to normal approximations. Monte Carlo
simulations are used to determine the accuracy of the point estimators under the different
sampling schemes. Results of bias and mean squared errors are compiled in the tables for
different levels of samples and probabilities. In the last section, CYP-GUIDES case study is
discussed where the standard and genetically guided therapy are compared to determine whether
one therapy is more effective than the other. Further, point estimators for the cross-product
ratio are computed for varying scenarios under the different sampling schemes.

# Coding
For coding and simulation, I used R program with codes for different sampling schemes.
